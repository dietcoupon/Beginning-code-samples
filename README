This is from when I went through Chris Pine's Introduction to Programming. It wasn't actually my introduction to programming, but it was an excellent piece-by-piece introduction to Ruby. It's a great guide because it forces the learner to get their hands dirty in code. All the book learning in the world is useless if you can't make anything of it.

So for a bit of a github-style hello world, I'm throwing a few of the cute little useless programs I came up with on here.
