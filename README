I recently worked through Chris Pine's Introduction to Programming. It wasn't truly my introduction to programming, but it was an excellent introduction to Ruby for a relative n00b like myself. It's a nice beginner's guide because it forces the learner to get their hands dirty in code, to successfully apply the concepts being conveyed. All the book learning in the world is useless if you can't make anything of it.

So for a bit of a github-style hello world, I'm throwing a few of the cute little useless programs I came up with on here. They're not the prettiest patches of code, being that...I'm a n00b...but they all get the job done, which seems like the important thing.
